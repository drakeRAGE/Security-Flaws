# Security Flaws

A comprehensive resource designed to help developers, students, and security enthusiasts understand and mitigate common security vulnerabilities in web applications. This site explores both frontend and backend security flaws, offering detailed explanations, practical code examples, and actionable fixes. Built with modern frameworks like ReactJS, TypeScript, Next.js, and Remix, this project is your go-to guide for mastering secure coding practices.

## Purpose

This site aims to:
- Educate users about critical security flaws in web applications.
- Break down how these vulnerabilities work and why they‚Äôre significant.
- Provide real-world code examples‚Äîboth vulnerable and secure‚Äîto illustrate concepts.
- Promote proactive security habits for building robust applications.

## Features

- **Interactive Learning**: Dive into frontend and backend vulnerabilities with in-depth explanations.
- **Code Examples**: Analyze vulnerable code, understand its weaknesses, and apply secure fixes.
- **Framework Focus**: Tailored to modern stacks like ReactJS, TypeScript, Next.js, and Remix.
